        <h2> NUTRITION</h2>
    <p class="gather">Nutrition is the process of consuming, absorbing, and using nutrients needed by the body for growth,
        development, and maintenance of life. To receive adequate, appropriate nutrition, people need to consume a
        it is then healthy diet, which consists of a variety of nutrients—the substances in foods that nourish the body.</p>

                    The benefits of therapy extend beyond those in treatment. For example, one person can go to individual therapy, 
                    but the other people in their life will likely benefit from that person’s improved communication and relationship interactions.
                    Group therapy is talk therapy with at least two people and at least one mental health professional.9 The people receiving therapy 
                    can interact with each other under the guidance and support of the mental health professional. For example, several people who are 
                    all recovering from addiction may benefit from having therapy together.

                    Meditation is hygiene for the mind. It clears out unproductive thoughts, creates clarity, and helps you learn more about yourself.
                    Most forms of meditation cultivate alpha brain waves, which are midrange, varying from eight to twelve cycles per second. Alpha waves 
                    are associated with inner focus, a state where we are aware of our environment but not reacting to it. Alpha state is relaxing and restorative
                    and generates peaceful, smooth, and calm feelings.
